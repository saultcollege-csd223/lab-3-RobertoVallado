  Pie charts are fun to look at and easy to understand. If you ask me, I would
  tell you I have <mark>NO IDEA WHATSOEVER</mark> of how to do this on regular
  HTML and CSS.
  <i>This is why I would without thinking twice use a JS library.</i>
</p>
<p>
  As a second sample I took on this simple pie chart. Nothing fancy, and the
  code is extremely simple to understand as we will see shortly.
  <br />
  Take a minute to hover trhough the chart and then move on unto the code. ðŸ¥§
</p>
<div class="chart-container">
  <canvas id="pieChartsTutorial"></canvas>
</div>
<script>
  const ctx1 = document.getElementById("pieChartsTutorial").getContext("2d");

  let angularVal = randomVal();
  let reactVal = randomVal();
  let jqueryVal = randomVal();
  let alpineVal = randomVal();
  let gPolymerVal = randomVal();
  let vueVal = randomVal();

  const pieChartsTutorial = new Chart(ctx1, {
    type: "pie",
    data: {
      labels: ["Angular", "React", "JQuery", "Alpine", "GooglePolymer", "Vue"],
      datasets: [
        {
          data: [
            angularVal,
            reactVal,
            jqueryVal,
            alpineVal,
            gPolymerVal,
            vueVal,
          ],
          backgroundColor: [
            "rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)",
            "rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)",
            "rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)",
            "rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)",
            "rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)",
            "rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)",
          ],
          borderColor: [
            "rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)",
            "rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)",
            "rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)",
            "rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)",
            "rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)",
            "rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)",
          ],
          borderWidth: 1,
        },
      ],
    },
  });

  function randomVal() {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 19);
  }
</script>
<p><br>
  In this case we made use of many values for the background color as they pair
  for the order in which they are represented in the <code>data array</code> as
  well as the <code>labels</code>. Just for demonstration pourposes we can also
  see a function that add values to certain variables belonging to the
  <i>data</i>. This is a great example of how we can add values dinamically to
  our chart.

<p>
  Now we have seen some basic Chart.js, and although pie charts are "fun to look
  at", I personally find them boring in the sense that I can't get that sense of
  actual: "serious data representation".
  <br />
  Let us move unto much more in dept samples with a bit more advanced ways to
  populate our data charts.
