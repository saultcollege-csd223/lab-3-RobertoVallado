<p>
  At this point we have seen most of what a <i>basic-intro</i> is, and more than
  enough to get you started with <code>Chart.js</code><br />
</p>
<p>
  I do however feel important to mention and take on some basic
  <i>'needs'</i> that I encountered, so we can say we are going to recap on some
  concepts for styling, labelings and colouring.
</p>
<h6>Labels</h6>
<p>
  For our bar and lines chart I felt it was going to be more professional
  without the color banner next to the label. So I did encounter the config that
  would help there.
</p>

<div class="code-container">
  <pre style="margin-bottom: 0px">
      <code class="language-javascript">
const lineChartOptions = {
    responsive: true,
    plugins: { //The path would be: options.plugins.legend.labels.boxWidth
        legend: {
        labels: {
            boxWidth: 0, //The boxWidth still there but now its width is ZERO! 
                        //as we specified it.
        },
        },
    },
};
    </code></pre>
</div>
<p>Lets think of our dot notation and how to interprete the docs.</p>
<p>
  An experienced developer would know this, but I thought important to mention
  that this is the way the docs make mention of values in the configuration.

<h6>Colouring & Styles</h6>
<p>
  As we know at this point, this is quite the powerful library. We can customize
  our charts easily by some tweaking of our <i>config body</i> or our
  <i>options body object</i>. <br /><br />
  Let's recap on those and see what other options are there!
</p>

<div class="code-container">
  <pre style="margin-bottom: 0px">
      <code class="language-javascript">
backgroundColor: [ "rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)"] //we change attributes such as backgroundColor

//We can also make use of color strings, those are recognize as well
borderColor: [ "green"] 
    </code></pre>
</div>

<h6>Tick configuration</h6>
<p>
  I thought this was pretty neat feature. I felt the tick options gave my charts
  a more professional look.
</p>

<div class="code-container">
  <pre style="margin-bottom: 0px">
      <code class="language-javascript">
options.scales[scaleId].ticks //this is the way we access the ticks in our options object
    </code></pre>
</div>

<p>
  Ticks is the <i>coordenate-like</i> background and there are many options for
  customization.

  Data visualization is fun and one of my favorite parts of programming. Feel
  free to clone the repo, fork it if you like. Play with it & feel free to try
  it and break it.
