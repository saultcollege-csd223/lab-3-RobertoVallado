<p>
  <code>Chart.js</code> is a javascript library that allows us to
  <i>easily</i> create charts for a better UI.
  <br />
  As we dive more in the basics of the library we will see some of the
  advantages of adding a library to our projects. <br /><br />
  So far we have engaged with Javascript libraries on this semester. We learned
  on JQuery and Alpine; we made use of its functionalities and realize how easy
  made our jobs at the time of writting code.
  <br />
  This website itself made use of
  <code>Bootstrap</code>, <code>JQuery</code>, <code>highlight.js</code> as it
  amalgams it all with <b>Chart.js</b> to improve <i>"Time saving"</i> for the
  developer.
  <br />
  <br />
  <mark>
    As Developers we have to learn to take advantages of this open chunks of
    code that will make our lives easier.</mark

<p>
  Some of the libraries are there to promote the use of certain products. For
  example: <code>PayPal</code>. <br />
  Paypal has its own library to make easier the life of the developer by being
  able to embed a whole checkout GUI in a website. I personally find that
  mind-blowing. I took on programming to help my financial situation and move
  unto passive income. Libraries like PayPal or others like
  <code>Stripe</code> let us move unto the next stage of the development without
  worrying about how we can secure our app.

  The current graph is a sample of how useful this library is when it comes to
  data visualization. üï∏Ô∏è

<div class="chart-container">
  <canvas id="introChart"></canvas>
</div>
<script>
  const ctx0 = document.getElementById("introChart");
  ctx0.getContext("2d");

  const myOptions = {
    responsive: true,
    maintainAspectRatio: false,
    scale: {
      angleLines: {
        display: true,
      },
    },
    ticks: {
      //   min: 0,
      max: 20,
      beginAtZero: true,
      stepSize: 5 /* 25 - 50 - 75 - 100 */,
    },
  };

  const introChart = new Chart(ctx0, {
    type: "radar",
    data: {
      labels: [
        "Kung-Fu",
        "Dog-poop scooping",
        "Skateboarding",
        "Motorcycle riding",
        "Programming",
        "Languages",
      ],
      datasets: [
        {
          label: "Skills Matrix",
          data: [16, 19, 12, 16, 18, 13],
          backgroundColor: "rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)",
          borderColor: "blue",
          borderWidth: 2,
        },
      ],
    },
    options: myOptions,
  });
</script>
<p>
  The code for this sample is very easy to understand and intuitive. BUT...First
  things first, we make use of libraries by either downoading it or using a CDN
  that we embed in our HMTL code. Is possible to
  <i>inspect</i> this website as a reference using your developer tools
  <i>(by pressing F12)</i>; I made sure to comment the header for your ease.
</p>
<h6>Note:</h6>
<p>
  All the following code is to be run in a <code>canvas</code> tag. As we
  inspect the code we will see how we are targetting the Canvas tag element
  using the DOM in order to manipulate it and inject the chart from our CDN.
</p>

<div class="code-container">
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
const ctx0 = document.getElementById("introChart"); //use DOM to target the HTML element canvas
ctx0.getContext("2d");

/*In this case I added a body of options that is nothing else but an object.
NOTE: chart.js has a specific order for the properties of the object to be.*/

const myOptions = { 
    responsive: true,
    maintainAspectRatio: false,
    scale: {
    angleLines: {
        display: true,
    },
    },
    ticks: {
    //   min: 0,
    max: 20,
    beginAtZero: true,
    stepSize: 5,
    },
};
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  I start instantiating my variables as a good practice. We will be making use
  of that object as a whole value that we will be able to tweak to suit our
  needs.
</p>
<div class="code-container">
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
/*IMPORTANT: Naming conventions are of great importance in Chart.js. 
the constant name of the chart has to be the same of the canvas id */

const introChart = new Chart(ctx0, { 
type: "radar", //type is the value where we define the type of chart.

/*data takes values such as labels and datasets 
    (this allows us to add more datasets dynamically) isnt that exiting? */

data: { 
labels: [
    "Kung-Fu",
    "Dog-poop scooping",
    "Skateboarding",
    "Motorcycle riding",
    "Programming",
    "Languages",
],
datasets: [
    {
    label: "Skills Matrix", //label name of my chart
/*'data' takes an array with values & 
    the library takes care of pair those values to the labels! */
        data: [16, 19, 12, 16, 18, 13],
        backgroundColor: "rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)", //colors to be added use RGB values
        borderColor: "blue",  //but it also takes strings for colors
        borderWidth: 2,
      },
    ],
  },
options: myOptions, //I made use of the object constant previously instanciated.
});
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  I personally like to first go to the docs of the library, skim the
  explanation, try to understand what is going on, copy and paste the first
  sample and give it a try.If there is a basic understanding of what the library
  does I can make better sense of its functionalities and the "<i>how</i>".
  <br />
  <br />
  We will move on unto some more examples that I found to be fun to try and
  hopefully we can get our <i>"hands dirty"</i> and learn by doing!üî®
